        As I said in report 00, I am new at HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I have just seen some codes before but
        never really touched them. After one week in the course I wouldn't call this "hard" language. It is
        logical and pretty easy to understand. Maybe because of the knowledge I got from Java, but this seems
        like a fun course and doesn't seem hard to learn at all.<br> <br>The only thing I have problem with right now is
        GitLab. I am more used to the "classic/simple" way where you easily upload a file from the pc just by
        selecting it with the mouse... But I understand that GitLab uses logs and so on, which may be needed in
        the future. Anyway. I am looking forward to learn more from this and the coming course.
