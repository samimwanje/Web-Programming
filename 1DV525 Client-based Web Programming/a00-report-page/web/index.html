        My name is <b>Sami Mwanje</b>. I am 24 years old and come from Uganda. I have lived in Sweden since I
        was 6 years. Right now I live in Skåne Osby, which means that I am taking the train to the school here
        in Växjö, which also means that I hate early lessons. It only takes 50 minutes so it's not that
        dangerous if you ask someone else. I am studying the third year of
        <i> Computer Science and Engineering </i>, and if everything goes as planed I will go for a master.<br><br>

        I don't have very much to say about my self expect to that I like play and watch football on my spare
        time. I am right now playing for a team in division 4 here in Osby. Except to the football I also have
        some big interests in math, science and computer Science, which is one of the main reasons that I choose
        to study Computer Science and Engineering. In high school I was studying <i> Social Sciences</i> which
        was not my main interest, therefore I went for the <i>Technical Preparatory year </i> here in Växjö
        right a year after I graduated from high school. After the technical preparatory year I went for the
        <i> Computer Science and Engineering </i> program. Today I am here learning JavaScript and HTML.
